- Understand the structure and weaknesses of Active Directory.
- Perform real-world internal AD attacks using Red Team techniques.
- Use tools like **PowerView**, **Rubeus**, **Mimikatz**, and **BloodHound** effectively.
- Exploit common AD misconfigurations:
  - Unconstrained Delegation
  - Kerberoasting
  - AS-REP Roasting
  - Abusing ACLs and GPOs
- Perform **lateral movement** and **persistence** techniques.
- Map Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework.
